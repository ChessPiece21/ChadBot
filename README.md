# ChadBot
Simple Discord bot I made because I like Pete Davidson's "Chad" character from <em>SNL</em>.

## Explanation
I like [Pete Davidson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Davidson)'s [Chad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuzGs8SfXBo) character on <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, and I frequently use the "ok" response. To create my first Discord bot ever, I made this.

## The Only Command
`/ok`

Returns a random GIF of Chad saying "ok."
