# ChadBot
Simple Discord bot I made because I like Pete Davidson's "Chad" character on SNL.

# Explanation
I like [Pete Davidson's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Davidson) [Chad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuzGs8SfXBo) character on ''SNL'', and I frequently use the "ok" response, so to create my first ever Discord bot I did that as a joke.

# The Only Command
`/ok`
Returns a random GIF of Chad saying "ok."
